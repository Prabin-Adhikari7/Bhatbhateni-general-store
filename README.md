# Bhatbhateni-general-store
The overall concept of the project is to create a software for a supermarket named "Bhatbhateni". The software allows the admin to input an item's name, unit price, and quantity and then calculates the marked price, VAT amount, and final amount. The calculated data is then returned as a JSON object.
